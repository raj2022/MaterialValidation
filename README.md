# Material Validation for Phase 0 and Phase 1 CMS Detector

Material validation has been done for the phase 0 and the phase 1 CMS(Compact Muon Solenoid) detector. The updated version can be found on the [Twiki page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/TrackerMaterialBudgetValidation). The Material budget has been done for all of the released [CMSSW versions](https://cms-sw.github.io/). All of the pre-releases for the corresponding CMSSW versions can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw).

Material validation involves verifying the composition and properties of the materials used in constructing various detector components. 

## Why we do Material Budget?
Material budget provide an overview about any detector. It helps in ensuring accurate measurements and simulations. As of now, we have comopletd the material validation for the Phase 0 and Phase 1 detector while we are still working on the Phase 2 detector, which we termed for [High Luminosity-LHC](https://hilumilhc.web.cern.ch/home/home). 

Material Budget describe the different components of the CMS detector, including the tracker, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and muon detectors. It Provide a list of materials used in each detector component, including support structures and readout electronics. It also explain the rationale behind the selection of these materials and their expected performance in the detector.

Material budget helps in to describe the techniques and methods used for material characterization, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nuclear activation analysis. It also help in discussing the measurements of density, radiation length, nuclear interaction length, and other relevant material properties.

It help us in the Radiation Damage studies. Through the help of material budget we can discuss the impact of radiation on materials due to the harsh conditions inside the CMS detector during data-taking. Also, we can present the results of radiation damage studies on materials to assess their long-term stability and effects on detector performance.
